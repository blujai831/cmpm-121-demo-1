This fork is maintained as a deliverable for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). I have incrementally modified this project, tracking my progress with git, to develop an incremental game of my own not-very-unique design.

## Note to Adam

I realize my implementation still comes in at closer to 200 than to 100 lines of code. I have followed to the best of my ability the detailed constructive criticism you were so kind as to take the time to offer me, and yet still I don't know how else to further optimize for low line count in my refactoring without doing something terrible like violating the 80-column rule or removing the empty lines between distinct code blocks, so I'm not sure how other students have been able to get their implementations down to around 100 lines of code assuming they have comparable feature sets. This notice is of course subject to change if I find a solution before the extended deadline.
